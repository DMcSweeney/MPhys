Made Git Repo for project and introduction to machine learning and Keras. <br>


PetCT, PCT and Vector field info is stored in DICOM format so need to read this into Python. 
Use [pyDICOM](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) or [simpleITK](http://www.simpleitk.org/).

SimpleITK is a C++ library with binary distribution for Python whereas pyDICOM is a python library.<br>

All data is open-source and can be found at: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Head-Neck-PET-CT <br>
I think this is the dataset they showed us.<br>
