Accurate and fast image registration using convolutional neural networks for head and neck cancer patients.<br>

# TODO

#### _Aims_
Apply DVFs from database to visualise registration<br>
Train CNN using available DVFs as labels<br>
Perform image registration on unseen data to produce high-quality DVFs<br>
